<!-- Before opening a PR:
- Make sure you have read CONTRIBUTING.md (found in the .github directory)
- These points are especially important
  - Major changes should be discussed in an issue before you start
  - Your changes should be in a new branch (not develop or gh-pages)
  - Make sure you have the .editorconfig plugin installed in VS Code
